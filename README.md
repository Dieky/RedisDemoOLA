## Configuration 4: Redis Security
[See this youtube video demonstrating config 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h__KvDNFuOE)
### Objective: To demonstrate how to set up security features in Redis.
Scenario: The company wants to ensure that user data is secure and can only be accessed by
authorized users. You need to set up security features in Redis to protect user data from
unauthorized access.
Tasks:
1. Install Redis on your machine and configure it to run on the default port (6379).
2. Use the Redis CLI or Redis Telnet CLI to set up a password for Redis.
3. Use the Redis CLI or Redis Telnet CLI to store user data in Redis.
4. Verify that Redis requires a password to access user data.
5. Use the Redis CLI or Redis Telnet CLI to set up access control lists (ACLs) to control
access to Redis commands and data.
